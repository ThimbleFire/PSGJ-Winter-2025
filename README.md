this is my repo for my piratesoftware 2025 winter gamejam game. this readme will serve as my development diary.

it's the 16th of January 11:30pm in London and I'm at work thinking of what to build. i don't know what the theme is yet.

I'd like to record my development live and submit it to YouTube as evidence of not using existing material, though i also doubt anyone will take interest as there's some 35K other participants. 

I'm thinking I'll stick to my strengths and make a short isometric rpg. I'll have a simple inventory system as i recognise i tend to spend multiple weeks on ui systems.
I'll have a black and white retro theme. I'll try to recreate my jigsaw dungeon algorithm from memory, map gen alone might take multiple days but if i can pull it off it'll be worth it,  I've gotten pretty familiar with godot, realistically it shouldn't take more than 12 hours. 

since I'm working full time I'll only be about to work on the game 6-7 hours a day. 

* I'll start my modelling sand animating the player and writing a python script to render its frames into a 2D sprite sheet.
* I'll create jigsaw pieces each with their own json files that contain map data. the json file contains information about the size of each piece and the locations and sizes of its entrances.
* I'll get the player moving around. I've been playing a ton of poe2 lately and i want to try implementing wsad movement. not sure on this right now though, might have to be point-and-click like diablo 2. if i decide to go point and click I'll need to first write a pathfinding algorithm as i'm not a fan of godot's built in pathfinder. 
* once the player is moving around and the map is generating i can put in a basic inventory and character window. I'll have equipment show up on the player in-game.
* once they're equipping gear i can add some basic melee attack.
* I'll have a ui to determine left and right+click behaviour
* I'll have the player pick between a mage and a warrior which changes their starting item.
* I'll have mobs spawn in rooms. their design will be determined by the theme of the project, but for now let's say they're zombies.

* I'll add health to everything and see how that feels, then start fleshing out the game as much as i can with the time constraints.
